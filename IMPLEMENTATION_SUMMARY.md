#### QR Code Data Structure:
```json
{
  "id": "product-id",
  "batch": "batch-number", 
  "name": "product-name",
  "farmer": "farmer-name",
  "harvest": "harvest-date",
  "status": "current-status",
  "verify": "verification-url",
  "track": "tracking-url",
  "timestamp": "generation-timestamp"
}
```

### QR Code Endpoints:
- `GET /api/products/:id/qr` - Generate product QR code (PNG/SVG)
- `GET /api/products/:id/qr/tracking` - Generate simple tracking QR
- `GET /api/products/:id/label` - Generate complete product label
- `POST /api/qr/parse` - Parse and validate QR code data
- `GET /track/:batchNumber` - Public tracking redirect
- `GET /verify/:batchNumber` - Public verification redirect

### QR Code Integration:
- **Automatic Generation**: QR codes created automatically when products are added
- **Real-time Data**: QR codes reflect current product status and information
- **Consumer Access**: Public URLs for easy consumer verification
- **Print-ready Labels**: Complete labels with QR codes and product information
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for mobile scanning applications
